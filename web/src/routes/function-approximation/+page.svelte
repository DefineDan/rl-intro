<h1>Function Approximation in Reinforcement Learning</h1>

      Here we'll talk about how to handle large or continuous state-action
      spaces in reinforcement learning. Starting with state aggregation and tile
      coding, we'll then move on to linear function approximation and neural
      networks. For now, take a look at <a

        class="alert-link">Tabular Methods</a
      > to get started with the basics of reinforcement learning.
